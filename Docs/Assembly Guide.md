## Assembly Guide:

This is going to be really rough as it's a pretty simple build but there is an order I found to be pretty efficient. I am assuming you're pretty crafty/mechanically inclined to be able to wield a soldering iron especially if you're able to 3D print these parts.

## Build:

Heatset Inserts first
  > How even and straight you press them in is pretty important for how the panels sit.

Insert Buttons into front panel

Insert USB-C Keystone Jack into Top Middle piece, there is an arrow to orientate you to which way. It only goes in one way.

Screw 4 or 5 of the 6 pieces onto the front panel, you would have to hold off on the Top Left piece so you can handle the PCBs.

Screw in the Menu Panel PCB, should take 2 M3s directly into the 3D print

Screw in Main PCB (ABB or BBB) directly into the 3D print

Start wiring your action and movement buttons
  > Take your time with this as how neat you handle it saves you so much space

Solder your Menu Panel the square through hole is ground, and if you're using a wiring harness you can snip/strip then solder it into the hole. You can pick the order of what you want your buttons to be. I generally did Start/Select/Home/TP/L3/R3. From Left to Right after the ground.

OPTIONAL Solder your/plug in your extra face buttons if you're using Stickless+ or Daigo-ish layouts

After you're done wiring you can screw Top Left/Bottom Left onto the front panel only reason why we didn't do this earlier as it was easier to manipulate these pieces to access.

Close it up and you should be good, if you mess up there is a little indent on Bottom Middle to let you open it up again
