## Printing Parts:
The [STL folder](https://github.com/phazil/Purple-Project-Redux/tree/main/For%20Makers/STLs) is organized for you to print the base version then expand onto any variations you're interested in.

***The Stickless+ Version Panels has the USB-C Keystone Passthrough collide with the button housings, an alternative version is provided where the USB-C port is shifted over to avoid colliding if you're not interested in clipping the port down.***

Each designed part can fit in a **250x250x250 volume** print bed

Total print time is about **10 hours** and around **11 with supports**.

Total filament used is about **300 grams**.

All parts are already orientated in printing position. The PCB piece can use **tree supports on the build plate only**. 
- 6 total pieces
	- Top Left
	- Top Right
	- Top Middle (Requires USB-C keystone jack panel mount)
	- Bottom Left
	- Bottom Middle
	- Bottom Right

These settings help give a rigid feeling when putting the build together. Although 3 walls/top layers will also work with a 20% infill density
- Printed in [Voron Spec](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings) hopefully
  - Layer height: 0.2mm
  - Extrusion width: 0.4mm, forced
  - Infill percentage: 40%
  - Infill type: grid, gyroid, honeycomb, triangle, or cubic
  - Wall count: 4
  - Solid top/bottom layers: 5
  - Supports: NONE
