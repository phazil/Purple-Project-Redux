## Ordering Guide

I used JLCPCB for these. 1.6mm PCB thickness. Remove Order Number. Pick your panel color and silkscreen color. Obviously white silkscreen on black panels and black on white panels if you want it like that. The back panel is reversible too if you're not interested in the logos. Pick whatever surface finish is cheapest for you or whatever you favor.

JLC QC/QA might flag you asking if there's any grounding/metal on the panels. Just accept the risks and they should come out fine.

Within the [Panel Production Files](https://github.com/phazil/Purple-Project-Redux/tree/main/For%20Makers/Panel%20Production%20Files) you need to pick a front panel then add on the back panels.

As for the MenuPanel you will need assembly as I did include 0 ohm resistors just in case they were needed.

The Zip file included has the production files/BOM/designators/locations, you can choose to have JLCPCB install the momentary push buttons or you can do them yourself. 1.6mm and whatever color you want if that matters.
